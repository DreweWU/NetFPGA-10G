Welcome to NetFPGA-10G Repository.

Before you start, please read the "Getting Started Guide" on the 
NetFPGA-10G wiki. 

http://netfpga10g.pbworks.com/Getting-Started-Guide

The following is a quick start for 1.0.0 release.

0. Requirement
- Xilinx ISE Design Suite: Embedded Edition 12.3
  EDK, including Xilinx Platform Studio (XPS) and Software 
  Development Kit (SDK) are necessary.
- Linux or Unix based system

1. Installation
- Make sure you have Xilinx ISE installed and $XILINX, $XILINX_EDK
  environment variables are set correctly
- Go to the root NetFPGA-10G directory
- Run "make install"

The above command will do the following actions.
- Copy necessary files from your Xilinx ISE installation
- Generate IP cores (10G Ethernet MAC and XAUI) and put them in the
  hardware library
- Some Xilinx files are patched to be enabled running on NetFPGA-10G
  board.
  
2. Run the production test
The production test check whether the board you have is fully working.
Please follow the instructions in
    projects/production_test/doc/NetFPGA10G_production_test.pdf

3. Build and play with the reference projects
Besides the production test, we provide a couple of reference projects
to allow you quickly start your development. Please read the README
file in each project directory for more information.

Enjoy NetFPGA-10G!
