This project is part of the Howth release. To rebuilt the project from 
source, follow the simple 2 steps.

1. Open nf10.xmp using Xilinx Platform Studio
2. Click Hardware - Generate bitstream

That's it! 

The bitfile locates in implementation/. You need to 
export it to your Xilinx SDK project in order to download the Microblaze 
program to BRAM.
