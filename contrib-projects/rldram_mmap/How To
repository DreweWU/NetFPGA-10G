Steps to implement rldram_mmap:

1. Download XAPP852 from Xilinx website - http://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/application_notes/xapp852.pdf

2. Extract the contents of XAPP825.zip under the hw/pcores/nf10_rldram_mmap_v1_00_a

3. In the hw/pcores/nf10_rldram_mmap_v1_00_a folder run 'make' - this will create, copy and patch neccessary Xilinx files for the rldram core

4. Run the project makefile to implement and generate bitstream and then program the FPGA

5. Reboot the system

6. Build and load the driver under the contrib-projects/nic/sw/host/drivers

> make

> insmod nf10.ko

7. Build the 'wraxi' and 'rdaxi' located under the contrib-projects/nic/sw/host/apps directory

> make

8. Read and write RLDRAM A & B -

Base address of RLDRAM A = 0x80000000
Base address of RLDRAM B = 0x84000000

> ./wraxi 80000000 12345678
> ./rdaxi 80000000

etc.
