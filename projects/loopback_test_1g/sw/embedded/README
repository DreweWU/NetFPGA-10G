This project is part of the Howth release. To rebuilt the SDK project from 
source, follow the simple 4 steps.

1. Export the platform specific files from XPS (HW) project by clicking Project -> Export to SDK
   Note: Do not select Export and Launch SDK
2. Open up Xilinx SDK, select the workspace at SDK_Workspace
3. In the Xilinx SDK GUI, click Project -> Repository and point the repository to netfpga-10g/lib/sw/
4. Import all projects under SDK_Workspace into your workspace by clicking File -> Import -> Existing projects

That's it!
Now you can build your project with standard Eclipse IDE :)
