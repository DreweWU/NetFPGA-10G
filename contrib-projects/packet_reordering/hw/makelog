Makefile to build a Microprocessor system :
Run make with any of the following targets
 
  netlist  : Generates the netlist for the given MHS 
  bits     : Runs Implementation tools to generate the bitstream
  exporttosdk: Export files to SDK
 
  init_bram: Initializes bitstream with BRAM data
  ace      : Generate ace file from bitstream and elf
  download : Downloads the bitstream onto the board
 
  sim      : Generates HDL simulation models and runs simulator for chosen simulation mode
  simmodel : Generates HDL simulation models for chosen simulation mode
 
  netlistclean: Deletes netlist
  bitsclean: Deletes bit, ncd, bmm files
  hwclean  : Deletes implementation dir
  simclean : Deletes simulation dir
  clean    : Deletes all generated files/directories
